ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘€ Hola, Iâ€™m @Mihir2811
- 
While working with numerous databases, I found myself to be a data-driven person and more inclined towards problem-solving skills. 
- 
Being a rookie, I still find myself to be an ambitious person when it comes to data and its application. 
-
I have learned to use Python and its libraries as my primary language for database application. 
-
Apart from that I have my skills in Tableau, MySQL and R language. 
-
For better Data visualization I have also learned to use Adobe Photoshop as my side interest.
